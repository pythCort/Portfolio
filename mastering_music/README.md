# Abstract

This tutorial presents a novel approach to organizational research by using music listening patterns as a data source. Attendees will learn the potential of studying music as an environmental stimulus and psychosocial factor, offering a familiar and engaging method for research participants. Attendees learn to use the Spotify API to access participantsâ€™ listening habits, as well as the analysis of acoustic properties and lyrical sentiment in music. Attendees are encouraged to have a Spotify account prior to attending, and will receive hands-on experience implementing these approaches in code.
